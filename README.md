# DART
DART is my end of degree project. Is an app that predicts the puntuation on a dartboard thanks to artificial vision. Thanks to a CNN it predicts the postion of the darts on an image, and then compares this image with others generated synthetically with 3D objects to estimate the orientation and puntuation of each dart.

# EXTRAS
The CNN was trained with synthetically generated and annotated images to avoid manually labeling the data.
